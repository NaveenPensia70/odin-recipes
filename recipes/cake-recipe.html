    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To whip up a scrumptious cake, start by gathering the essential ingredients: flour, sugar, eggs, butter, baking powder, and vanilla extract. Preheat the oven to the specified temperature while you mix the ingredients into a smooth batter. Pour the batter into a greased cake pan and let it bake until a toothpick inserted comes out clean.

Once the cake is golden and firm, take it out of the oven, let it cool, and perhaps frost it with your favorite icing for an extra touch of sweetness. This straightforward recipe promises a moist and flavorful cake that's perfect for any celebration or simply satisfying a sweet craving. Enjoy a slice of homemade goodness!</p>
