    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>To whip up a delicious homemade burger, start by forming ground beef into patties seasoned with salt and pepper. Preheat a grill or stovetop pan over medium-high heat. Cook the patties to your desired doneness, typically around 4-5 minutes per side for medium. While the patties cook, slice fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and onions for toppings. Toast burger buns on the grill or in a toaster. Once the patties are done, assemble your burger by placing them on the toasted buns and adding your preferred toppings. You can also include condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise for extra flavor. The result is a juicy and flavorful homemade burger ready to be enjoyed â€“ a simple and satisfying treat for any meal.</p>
